Copy these files into the user/ directory of your xv6 code.

Fill in the parts commented "fill this in!".  (You may need some other
small tweaks here and there, and can of course add whatever other
functions you like.)

You'll need to add spinlock.o, threads.o, condvar.o, mutex.o, and
semaphore.o to the USER_LIBS variable in user/makefile.mk.

You'll also need to add #include directives for spinlock.h, threads.h,
condvar.h, mutex.h, and semaphore.h to user/user.h.
